**TL;DR:** A perfect and flawless configuration setup should ensure (a) keys can be read from file AND from environment variable (b) secrets are kept outside committed code (c) config is hierarchical for easier findability. There are only a few packages that can help tick most of those boxes like [nconf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nconf) and [config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config).

**Otherwise:** Failing to satisfy any of the config requirements will simply bog down the development or devops team. Probably both

**TL;DR:** Handling async errors in callback style is probably the fastest way to hell (a.k.a the pyramid of doom). The best gift you can give to your code is using a reputable promise library or async-await instead which enables a much more compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch

**Otherwise:** Node.JS callback style, function(err, response), is a promising way to un-maintainable code due to the mix of error handling with casual code, excessive nesting and awkward coding patterns

**TL;DR:** Many throws errors as a string or as some custom type ‚Äì this complicates the error handling logic and the interoperability between modules. Whether you reject a promise, throw exception or emit error ‚Äì using only the built-in Error object will increase uniformity and prevent loss of information


**Otherwise:** When invoking some component, being uncertain which type of errors come in return ‚Äì it makes proper error handling much harder. Even worse, using custom types to describe errors might lead to loss of critical error information like the stack trace!

**TL;DR:** Operational errors (e.g. API received an invalid input) refer to known cases where the error impact is fully understood and can be handled thoughtfully. On the other hand, programmer error (e.g. trying to read undefined variable) refers to unknown code failures that dictate to gracefully restart the application

**Otherwise:** You may always restart the application when an error appears, but why let ~5000 online users down because of a minor, predicted, operational error? the opposite is also not ideal ‚Äì keeping the application up when an unknown issue (programmer error) occurred might lead to an unpredicted behavior. Differentiating the two allows acting tactfully and applying a balanced approach based on the given context

**TL;DR:** Error handling logic such as mail to admin and logging should be encapsulated in a dedicated and centralized object that all endpoints (e.g. Express middleware, cron jobs, unit-testing) call when an error comes in.

**Otherwise:** Not handling errors within a single place will lead to code duplication and probably to improperly handled errors

**TL;DR:** Let your API callers know which errors might come in return so they can handle these thoughtfully without crashing. This is usually done with REST API documentation frameworks like Swagger

**Otherwise:** An API client might decide to crash and restart only because he received back an error he couldn‚Äôt understand. Note: the caller of your API might be you (very typical in a microservice environment)

## ![‚úî] 2.6 Shut the process gracefully when a stranger comes to town

**TL;DR:** When an unknown error occurs (a developer error, see best practice number #3)- there is uncertainty about the application healthiness. A common practice suggests restarting the process carefully using a ‚Äòrestarter‚Äô tool like Forever and PM2

**Otherwise:** When an unfamiliar exception is caught, some object might be in a faulty state (e.g an event emitter which is used globally and not firing events anymore due to some internal failure) and all future requests might fail or behave crazily

**TL;DR:** Whether professional automated QA or plain manual developer testing ‚Äì Ensure that your code not only satisfies positive scenario but also handle and return the right errors. Testing frameworks like Mocha & Chai can handle this easily (see code examples within the "Gist popup")

**Otherwise:** Without testing, whether automatically or manually, you can‚Äôt rely on our code to return the right errors. Without meaningful errors ‚Äì there‚Äôs no error handling

**TL;DR:** Monitoring and performance products (a.k.a APM) proactively gauge your codebase or API so they can auto-magically highlight errors, crashes and slow parts that you were missing

**Otherwise:** You might spend great effort on measuring API performance and downtimes, probably you‚Äôll never be aware which are your slowest code parts under real world scenario and how these affects the UX

**TL;DR:** Any exception thrown within a promise will get swallowed and discarded unless a developer didn‚Äôt forget to explictly handle. Even if your code is subscribed to process.uncaughtException! Overcome this by registering to the event process.unhandledRejection

**Otherwise:** Your errors will get swallowed and leave no trace. Nothing to worry about

**Otherwise:** Consider this ‚Äì your function expects a numeric argument ‚ÄúDiscount‚Äù which the caller forgets to pass, later on your code checks if Discount!=0 (amount of allowed discount is greater than zero), then it will allow the user to enjoy a discount.

## ![‚úî] 3.1 –ò—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É–π—Ç–µ ESLint

**TL;DR:** ESLint is the de-facto standard for checking code style, not only to identify nitty-gritty spacing issues but also to detect serious code anti-patterns like developers throwing errors without classification. Using ESLint and following the rest of the code style practices below means following the same styles used by the rest of the community, as well as the same code styles used in the core products themselves.

**Otherwise:** developers will focus on tedious spacing and line-width concerns

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.2 –°–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –ø–ª–∞–≥–∏–Ω—ã Node JS

**TL;DR:** On top of ESLint standard rules that cover vanilla JS only, add Node-specific plugins like [eslint-plugin-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-node), [eslint-plugin-mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-mocha) and [eslint-plugin-node-security](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-security)

**Otherwise:** Many faulty Node.JS code patterns might escape under the radar. For example, developers might require(variableAsPath) files with a variable given as path which allows attackers to execute any JS script. Node.JS linters can detect such patterns and complain early

<br/><br/>

**TL;DR:** The opening curly braces of a code block should be in the same line of the opening statement.

### Code Example
```javascript
  // –•–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ
  function someFunction() {
    // code block
  }

  // –ü–ª–æ—Ö–æ
  function someFunction
  {
    // code block
  }
```

**Otherwise:** Deferring from this best practice might lead to unexpected results, as seen in the Stackoverflow thread below:

## ![‚úî] 3.4 –ù–µ –∑–∞–±—ã–≤–∞–π—Ç–µ —Ç–æ—á–∫—É —Å –∑–∞–ø—è—Ç–æ–π

**TL;DR:** While not unanimously agreed upon, it is still recommended to put a semicolon at the end of each statement. This will make your code more readable and explicit to other developers who read it.

**Otherwise:** As seen in the previous section, JavaScript's interpeter automatically adds a semicolon at the end of a statement if there isn't one which might lead to some undesired results.

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.5 –ù–∞–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞–π—Ç–µ –∏–º—è –≤–∞—à–∏–º —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏—è–º

**TL;DR:** Name all functions, including closures and callbacks. Avoid anonymous functions. This is especially useful when profiling a node app. Naming all functions will allow you to easily understand what you're looking at when checking a memory snapshot.

**Otherwise:** Debugging production issues using a core dump (memory snapshot) might become challenging as you notice significant memory consumption from anonymous functions.

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.6 Naming conventions for variables, constants, functions and classes

**TL;DR:** Use ***lowerCamelCase*** when naming variables and functions, ***UpperCamelCase*** (capital first letter as well) when naming classes and ***UPPERCASE*** for constants. This will help you to easily distinguish between plain variables / functions, and classes that require instantiation. Use descriptive names, but try to keep them short.

**Otherwise:** Javascript is the only language in the world which allows to invoke a constructor ("Class") directly without instantiating it first. Consequently, Classes and function-constructors are differentiated by starting with UpperCamelCase.

### Code Example ###
```javascript
  // for class name we use UpperCamelCase
  class SomeClassExample () { 
    
    // for const name we use UPPERCASE
    const CONFIG = {
      key: 'value'
    };
    
    // for variables and functions names we use lowerCamelCase
    let someVariableExample = 'value';
    function doSomething() {
      
    }

  }
```

**TL;DR:** Using `const` means that once a variable is assigned, it cannot be reassigned. Prefering const will help you to not be tempted to use the same variable for different uses, and make your code clearer. If a variable needs to be reassigned, in a for loop for example, use `let` to declare it. Another important aspect of let is that a variable declared using let is only available in the block scope in which it was defined. `var` is function scoped, not block scoped, and [shouldn't be used in ES6](https://hackernoon.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-var-anymore-f109a58b9b70) now that you have const and let at your disposal.

**Otherwise:** Debugging becomes way more cumbersome when following a variable that frequently changes.

**TL;DR:** Require modules at the beginning of each file, before and outside of any functions. This simple best practice will not only help you easily and quickly tell the dependencies of a file right at the top, but also avoids a couple of potential problems.

**Otherwise:** Requires are run synchronously by NodeJS. If they are called from within a function, it may block other requests from being handled at a more critical time. Also, if a required module or any of its own dependencies throw an error and crash the server, it is best to find out about it as soon as possible, which might not be the case if that module is required from within a function.

**TL;DR:** When developing a module/library in a folder, place an index.js file that exposes the module's
internals so every consumer will pass through it. This serves as an 'interface' to your module and ease
future changes without breaking the contract.

**Otherwise:** Changing to the internal structure of files or the signature may break the interface with
clients.

### Code example
```javascript
  // Do
  module.exports.SMSProvider = require('./SMSProvider');
  module.exports.SMSNumberResolver = require('./SMSNumberResolver');

  // Avoid
  module.exports.SMSProvider = require('./SMSProvider/SMSProvider.js');
  module.exports.SMSNumberResolver = require('./SMSNumberResolver/SMSNumberResolver.js');
```

## ![‚úî] 3.10 –ò—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É–π—Ç–µ –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä `===`

**TL;DR:** Prefer the strict equality operator `===` over the weaker abstract equality operator `==`. `==` will compare two variables after converting them to a common type. There is no type conversion in `===`, and both variables must be of the same type to be equal.

**Otherwise:** Unequal variables might return true when compared with the `==` operator.

### Code example
```javascript
'' == '0'           // false
0 == ''             // true
0 == '0'            // true

false == 'false'    // false
false == '0'        // true

false == undefined  // false
false == null       // false
null == undefined   // true

' \t\r\n ' == 0     // true
```
All statements above will return false if used with `===`

## ![‚úî] 3.11 –ò—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É–π—Ç–µ Async Await, –∏–∑–±–µ–≥–∞–π—Ç–µ callback-–æ–≤

**TL;DR:** Node 8 LTS now has full support for Async-await. This is a new way of dealing with asyncronous code which supersedes callbacks and promises. Async-await is non-blocking, and it makes asynchronous code look synchronous. The best gift you can give to your code is using async-await which provides a much more compact and familiar code syntax like try-catch.

**Otherwise:** Handling async errors in callback style is probably the fastest way to hell - this style forces to check errors all over, deal with akward code nesting and make it difficult to reason about the code flow.

**TL;DR:** Though it's recommended to use async-await and avoid function parameters, when dealing with older API that accept promises or callbacks - arrow functions make the code structure more compact and keep the lexical context of the root function (i.e. 'this').

**Otherwise:** Longer code (in ES5 functions) is more prone to bugs and cumbersome to read.

## ![‚úî] 4.1 At the very least, write API (component) testing

**TL;DR:** Most projects just don't have any automated testing due to short time tables or often the 'testing project' run out of control and being abandoned. For that reason, prioritize and start with API testing which are the easiest to write and provide more coverage than unit testing (you may even craft API tests without code using tools like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). Afterwards, should you have more resources and time, continue with advanced test types like unit testing, DB testing, performance testing, etc

**Otherwise:** You may spend long days on writing unit tests to find out that you got only 20% system coverage

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 4.2 Detect code issues with ESLint + specific Node plugin rules

**TL;DR:** ESLint is the de-facto standard for checking code style, not only to identify nitty-gritty spacing issues but also to detect serious code anti-patterns like developers throwing errors without classification. On top of ESLint standard rules that cover vanilla JS only, add Node-specific plugins like [eslint-plugin-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-node), [eslint-plugin-mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-mocha) and [eslint-plugin-node-security](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-security)

**Otherwise:** Many faulty Node.JS code patterns might escape under the radar. For example, developers might require(variableAsPath) files with a variable given as path which allows attackers to execute any JS script. Node.JS linters can detect such patterns and complain early


<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 4.3 Carefully choose your CI platform (Jenkins vs CircleCI vs Travis vs Rest of the world)

**TL;DR:** Your continuous integration platform (CICD) will host all the quality tools (e.g test, lint) so it should come with a vibrant ecosystem of plugins. [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) used to be the default for many projects as it has the biggest community along with a very powerful platform at the price of complex setup that demands a steep learning curve. Nowdays, it became much easier to setup a CI solution using SaaS tools like [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) and others. These tools allow crafting a flexible CI pipeline without the burden of managing the whole infrastructure. Eventually, it's a trade-off between robustness and speed - choose your side carefully.

**Otherwise:** Choosing some niche vendor might get you blocked once you need some advanced customization. On the other hand, going with Jenkins might burn precious time on infrastructure setup

üîó [**–ü–æ–¥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–µ–µ: Choosing CI platform**](/sections/testingandquality/citools.md)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 4.4 Constantly inspect for vulnerable dependencies

**TL;DR:** Even the most reputable dependencies such as Express have known vulnerabilities. This can get easily tamed using community and commercial tools such as üîó [nsp](https://github.com/nodesecurity/nsp) that can be invoked from your CI on every build

**Otherwise:** Keeping your code clean from vulnerabilities without dedicated tools will require to constantly follow online publications about new threats. Quite tedious

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 4.5 Tag your tests

**TL;DR:**  Different tests must run on different scenarios: quick smoke, IO-less, tests should run when a developer saves or commits a file, full end-to-end tests usually run when a new pull request is submitted, etc. This can be achieved by tagging tests with keywords like #cold #api #sanity so you can grep with your testing harness and invoke the desired subset. For example, this is how you would invoke only the sanity test group with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/):  mocha --grep 'sanity'

**Otherwise:** Running all the tests, including tests that perform dozens of DB queries, any time a developer makes a small change can be extremly slow and keeps developers away from running tests

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 4.6 Check your test coverage, it helps to identify wrong test patterns

**TL;DR:** Code coverage tools like [Istanbul/NYC ](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)are great for 3 reasons: it comes for free (no effort is required to benefit this reports), it helps to identify a decrease in testing coverage, and last but not least it highlights testing mismatches: by looking at colored code coverage reports you may notice, for example, code areas that are never tested like catch clauses (meaning that tests only invoke the happy paths and not how the app behaves on errors). Set it to fail builds if the coverage falls under a certain threshold

**Otherwise:** There won't be any automated metric telling you when a large portion of your code is not covered by testing

**TL;DR:** Use your preferred tool (e.g. 'npm outdated' or [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) to detect installed packages which are outdated, inject this check into your CI pipeline and even make a build fail in a severe scenario. For example, a severe scenario might be when an installed package is 5 patch commits behind (e.g. local version is 1.3.1 and repository version is 1.3.8) or it is tagged as deprecated by its author - kill the build and prevent deploying this version

**Otherwise:** Your production will run packages that have been explicitly tagged by their author as risky

**TL;DR:** End to end (e2e) testing which includes live data used to be the weakest link of the CI process as it depends on multiple heavy services like DB. Docker-compose turns this problem into a breeze by crafting production-like environment using a simple text file and easy commands. It allows crafting all the dependent services, DB and isolated network for e2e testing. Last but not least, it can keep a stateless environment that is invoked before each test suite and dies right after


**Otherwise:** Without docker-compose teams must maintain a testing DB for each testing environment including developers machines, keep all those DBs in sync so test results won't vary across environments

**TL;DR:** Monitoring is a game of finding out issues before customers do ‚Äì obviously this should be assigned unprecedented importance. The market is overwhelmed with offers thus consider starting with defining the basic metrics you must follow (my suggestions inside), then go over additional fancy features and choose the solution that ticks all boxes. Click ‚ÄòThe Gist‚Äô below for overview of solutions

## ![‚úî] 5.2. Increase transparency using smart logging

**TL;DR:** Logs can be a dumb warehouse of debug statements or the enabler of a beautiful dashboard that tells the story of your app. Plan your logging platform from day  1: how logs are collected, stored and analyzed to ensure that the desired information (e.g. error rate, following an entire transaction through services and servers, etc) can really be extracted

**Otherwise:** You end-up with a blackbox that is hard to reason about, then you start re-writing all logging statements to add additional information

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 5.3. Delegate anything possible (e.g. gzip, SSL) to a reverse proxy

**TL;DR:** Node is awfully bad at doing CPU intensive tasks like gzipping, SSL termination, etc. Instead, use a ‚Äòreal‚Äô middleware services like nginx, HAproxy or cloud vendor services

**Otherwise:** Your poor single thread will keep busy doing networking tasks instead of dealing with your application core and performance will degrade accordingly

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 5.4. Lock dependencies

**TL;DR:** Your code must be identical across all environments, but amazingly NPM lets dependencies drift across environments by default ‚Äì when you install packages at various environments it tries to fetch packages‚Äô latest patch version. Overcome this by using NPM config files , .npmrc, that tell each environment to save the exact (not the latest) version of each package. Alternatively, for finer grain control use NPM‚Äù shrinkwrap‚Äù. *Update: as of NPM5 , dependencies are locked by default. The new package manager in town, Yarn, also got us covered by default

**Otherwise:** QA will thoroughly test the code and approve a version that will behave differently at production. Even worse, different servers at the same production cluster might run different code

## ![‚úî] 5.5. Guard process uptime using the right tool

**TL;DR:** The process must go on and get restarted upon failures. For simple scenario, ‚Äòrestarter‚Äô tools like PM2 might be enough but in today ‚Äòdockerized‚Äô world ‚Äì a cluster management tools should be considered as well

**Otherwise:** Running dozens of instances without clear strategy and too many tools together (cluster management, docker, PM2) might lead to a devops chaos

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 5.6. Utilize all CPU cores

**TL;DR:** At its basic form, a Node app runs on a single CPU core while all other are left idling. It‚Äôs your duty to replicate the Node process and utilize all CPUs ‚Äì For small-medium apps you may use Node Cluster or PM2. For a larger app consider replicating the process using some Docker cluster (e.g. K8S, ECS) or deployment scripts that are based on Linux init system (e.g. systemd)

**Otherwise:** Your app will likely utilize only 25% of its available resources(!) or even less. Note that a typical server has 4 CPU cores or more, naive deployment of Node.JS utilizes only 1 (even using PaaS services like AWS beanstalk!)

## ![‚úî] 5.7. Create a ‚Äòmaintenance endpoint‚Äô

**TL;DR:** Expose a set of system-related information, like memory usage and REPL, etc in a secured API. Although it‚Äôs highly recommended to rely on standard and battle-tests tools, some valuable information and operations are easier done using code

**Otherwise:** You‚Äôll find that you‚Äôre performing many ‚Äúdiagnostic deploys‚Äù ‚Äì shipping code to production only to extract some information for diagnostic purposes

## ![‚úî] 5.8. Discover errors and downtime using APM products

**TL;DR:** Monitoring and performance products (a.k.a APM) proactively gauge codebase and API so they can auto-magically go beyond traditional monitoring and measure the overall user-experience across services and tiers. For example, some APM products can highlight a transaction that loads too slow on the end-users side while suggesting the root cause

**Otherwise:** You might spend great effort on measuring API performance and downtimes, probably you‚Äôll never be aware which is your slowest code parts under real world scenario and how these affects the UX

**TL;DR:** Code with the end in mind, plan for production from day 1. This sounds a bit vague so I‚Äôve compiled a few development tips that are closely related to production maintenance (click Gist below)

**Otherwise:** A world champion IT/devops guy won‚Äôt save a system that is badly written

## ![‚úî] 5.10. Measure and guard the memory usage

**TL;DR:** Node.js has controversial relationships with memory: the v8 engine has soft limits on memory usage (1.4GB) and there are known paths to leaks memory in Node‚Äôs code ‚Äì thus watching Node‚Äôs process memory is a must. In small apps you may gauge memory  periodically using shell commands but in medium-large app consider baking your memory watch into a robust monitoring system

**Otherwise:** Your process memory might leak a hundred megabytes a day like happened in Wallmart

## ![‚úî] 5.11. Get your frontend assets out of Node

**TL;DR:** Serve frontend content using dedicated middleware (nginx, S3, CDN) because Node performance really gets hurt when dealing with many static files due to its single threaded model

**Otherwise:** Your single Node thread will be busy streaming hundreds of html/images/angular/react files instead of  allocating all its resources for the task it was born for ‚Äì serving dynamic content

<br/><br/>


## ![‚úî] 5.12. Be stateless, kill your Servers almost every day

**TL;DR:** Store any type of data (e.g. users session, cache, uploaded files) within external data stores. Consider ‚Äòkilling‚Äô your servers periodically or use ‚Äòserverless‚Äô platform (e.g. AWS Lambda) that explicitly enforces a stateless behavior

**Otherwise:** Failure at a given server will result in application downtime instead of just killing a faulty machine. Moreover, scaling-out elasticity will get more challenging due to the reliance on a specific server

<br/><br/>


## ![‚úî] 5.13. Use tools that automatically detect vulnerabilities

**TL;DR:** Even the most reputable dependencies such as Express have known vulnerabilities (from time to time) that can put a system at risk. This can get easily tamed using community and commercial tools that constantly check for vulnerabilities and warn (locally or at GitHub), some can even patch them immediately

**Otherwise:** Otherwise: Keeping your code clean from vulnerabilities without dedicated tools will require to constantly follow online publications about new threats. Quite tedious

<br/><br/>


## ![‚úî] 5.14. Assign ‚ÄòTransactionId‚Äô to each log statement

**TL;DR:** Assign the same identifier, transaction-id: {some value}, to each log entry within a single request. Then when inspecting errors in logs, easily conclude what happened before and after. Unfortunately, this is not easy to achieve in Node due its async nature, see code examples inside

**Otherwise:** Looking at a production error log without the context ‚Äì what happened before ‚Äì makes it much harder and slower to reason about the issue

<br/><br/>


## ![‚úî] 5.15. Set NODE_ENV=production

**TL;DR:** Set the environment variable NODE_ENV to ‚Äòproduction‚Äô or ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô to flag whether production optimizations should get activated ‚Äì many NPM packages determining the current environment and optimize their code for production

**Otherwise:** Omitting this simple property might greatly degrade performance. For example, when using Express for server side rendering omitting NODE_ENV makes the slower by a factor of three!

<br/><br/>


## ![‚úî] 5.16. Design automated, atomic and zero-downtime deployments

**TL;DR:** Researches show that teams who perform many deployments ‚Äì lowers the probability of severe production issues. Fast and automated deployments that don‚Äôt require risky manual steps and service downtime significantly improves the deployment process. You should probably achieve that using Docker combined with CI tools as they became the industry standard for streamlined deployment

**Otherwise:** Long deployments -> production down time & human-related error -> team unconfident and in making deployment -> less deployments and features
